// component system (NoopMetrics / NoopCard / StatTile / SectionHeader /
// SegmentedPillControl / SourceBadge) so every card, tile and row lines up:
//
//  • a range pill (7D / 30D / 90D / 1Y / All) that filters the loaded sessions,
//  • a LazyVGrid of summary StatTiles (count / time / calories / distance / most-active),
//  • an "ACTIVITY BREAKDOWN" LazyVGrid of per-sport NoopCards — identical internal layout,
//  • an "ALL SESSIONS" NoopCard containing fixed-height rows (date · sport · dur · HR · kcal · dist · source).
//
// No custom card heights, paddings, colours or surfaces — uniformity is the bar.
