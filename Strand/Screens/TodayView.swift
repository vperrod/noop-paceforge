// The owner's complaint was "cards then random space". This rebuild is a tight,
// GAPLESS dashboard grid: one column of uniform sections, every gap == NoopMetrics.gap,
// every section break == NoopMetrics.sectionGap, equal margins from ScreenScaffold.
//
// Composition (top → bottom):
//   (a) HERO, full-width HStack that fills the width EQUALLY: RecoveryRing (left card)
//               + InsightCard "Today's Synthesis" (right card). No lone card, no gap.
//   (b) METRICS, one adaptive LazyVGrid of fixed-104pt StatTiles (Recovery, Strain,
//               Sleep, HRV, RHR, SpO2, Respiratory, Steps, Weight, Calories) each with
//               a 14-day sparkline so the grid tiles perfectly with no empty cells.
//   (c) LAST WORKOUTS, the SAME adaptive grid of fixed-104pt workout StatTiles.
//   (d) DATA SOURCES, one full-width NoopCard footer of SourceBadges + counts.
//
// Sparse series (weight) fall back to ALL history so a tile never shows an empty
// state when data exists. Only locked StrandDesign components are used.

/// SourceBadge + ScoreStatePill block), the column's intrinsic height climbed past 150 and the fixed frame
/// CLIPPED it, so the badge under the Rest ring overlapped the content below (the reported overlap glitch).
