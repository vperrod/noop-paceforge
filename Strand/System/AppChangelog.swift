On a genuinely easy day your heart rate never gets there, so the honest answer really is near zero - the same way a WHOOP low-strain day reads low. The number was right, but a bare \"0.0\" looked broken, so Today now adds a short line explaining it. We also fixed the WHOOP 5.0/MG case where Effort could sit un-scored for hours: the 5.0/MG sends live heart rate far less often than a 4.0, and the gauge needed a fixed *number* of readings before it would score - now it scores once it has enough *time* of heart-rate coverage, so a steady 5.0/MG stream counts and the gauge stops falling back to a stale value.

A fellow developer's work on real 5/MG hardware found this (history went from 0 to hundreds of frames once clocked) along with several smaller protocol fixes NOOP now carries: the history request waits for the strap to acknowledge a range query first (with a retry if it stays silent), an Android 5/MG connects directly to the strap your phone already paired instead of re-scanning, fresh history is scored within seconds instead of at the next 15-minute tick, and the strap's own diagnostic messages now appear in the strap log. Also new (Android, opt-in, default OFF): \"Record 5/MG raw capture\" in Settings → Experimental writes each history sync's raw frames to a shareable file - if you have a 5/MG, sharing one capture is the single most useful thing you can do to help NOOP learn to decode 5/MG sleep, recovery and strain.
