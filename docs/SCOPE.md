# Scope & non-goals

NOOP exists to give you **your own strap data, offline and on-device**. That mission sets hard limits
on what belongs in the app. This page names the WHOOP-app features that stay **out of scope** — and the
local equivalents that stay **in scope** — so a parity proposal has a standing answer before a PR is
opened. It does not change the constraints stated in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md), the
[Contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md), or the [Disclaimer](../DISCLAIMER.md); it maps them onto specific
features so the boundary is discoverable.

## The constraints this follows from

NOOP is **offline-first, on-device, and anonymous**: no NOOP-operated server, no account, no cloud
dependency, no telemetry, and **not a medical device** (see the
[Disclaimer](../DISCLAIMER.md#5-not-a-medical-device)). Those are hard constraints, not preferences.
The one explicit network-export exception is the default-off Experimental self-hosted push described
below. Everything else on this page is a consequence of these constraints, not a separate rule.

## Out of scope

These map to features visible in WHOOP-app reverse-engineering, but they conflict with the constraints
above. They are out of scope **unless the project deliberately changes its scope** in a tracked issue.

| Feature (WHOOP parity) | Why it's out of scope | Ref |
|---|---|---|
| Possible-arrhythmia / diagnostic-style alerts | A medical-device-style claim. NOOP is explicitly **not a medical device** and must not tell a user they may have a health condition. | #752 |
| Community feeds, team chat, social graph, leaderboards, cloud messaging | Require a **server, accounts, and an identity** — the opposite of anonymous and offline. | #755 |
| Cloud- or account-dependent coaching / notification parity | Requires cloud identity and server sync. NOOP's coach is strictly bring-your-own-key and on-device. | — |
| Anything requiring telemetry, an app-dependent/hosted server sync, user identity, or medical claims | Fails a hard constraint directly. The default-off self-hosted export below is the narrow exception: NOOP never depends on its receiver. | — |

## In scope — the local, non-diagnostic equivalents

The point of a boundary is to say what *is* welcome. These stay in scope because they run entirely
on-device from NOOP's own data and make no medical claim.

- **Local rhythm instrumentation.** Surfacing RR/IBI or beat-to-beat variability for the user's own
  curiosity is fine **only** as **default-off instrumentation** with explicit **non-diagnostic** wording
  — never an alert, never a health warning, never "possible arrhythmia" language, and never feeding a
  downstream gate. This mirrors the physiological-signal rule in
  [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md): an unproven derivation lands as instrumentation, not a shipped feature.
- **Local notifications from NOOP's own metrics** — charge, alarm, sync state — computed on-device.
- **Local export / import / reporting** — your data leaves only when *you* export it, including the
  explicit, default-off standing export described below.
- **Offline insights and explainers** that need no cloud identity.

## Experimental exception — self-hosted one-way push

Issue #1314 deliberately changed the scope for one narrow export path. NOOP may offer a
**default-off Experimental** client that sends incremental data to an HTTP(S) endpoint the user owns
and configures. It remains in scope only while all of these boundaries hold:

- With no endpoint configured, it never runs: no network egress and no change to current battery,
  screens, scores, or local behaviour.
- It runs in an independent background job after a successful strap offload. Receiver latency,
  failure, or misconfiguration must never delay or interfere with the strap sync path.
- It only exports rows. NOOP does not fetch rows, commands, settings, URLs, schemas, or conflict
  decisions from the receiver; the local on-device database remains the sole authority. The receiver
  may advertise only a subset of the client's fixed versioned stream registry so unsupported data is
  not read or sent.
- Identity is local to the installation and device. There is no NOOP account, hosted service,
  third-party destination, or telemetry channel. Endpoint and bearer credential are user supplied.
- This repository ships the Android and iOS clients and the versioned [push format](PUSH_PROTOCOL.md), not a server.
  A receiver, dashboard, vault, or agent belongs to the user and lives outside this repository.

This is automated export, not restore or two-way sync. A NOOP-operated receiver, accounts, server
read-back, remote writes, or making app behaviour depend on endpoint availability remain out of
scope. The feature stays Experimental until its Android and iOS background behaviour is proven quiet
and reliable in real-world use.

## Proposing a scope change

Scope changes are deliberate, not incidental. If you believe one of the out-of-scope areas should move,
open an issue that names the constraint it touches and how it would be satisfied — don't open the PR
first. A "WHOOP has it" argument, on its own, is not a reason: NOOP is a clean-room, offline, anonymous
tool, not a WHOOP clone.
